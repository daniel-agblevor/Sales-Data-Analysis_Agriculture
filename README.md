**Source:**  
[Specify the data source here, e.g., internal company records, public datasets, etc.]

**Structure:**  
The dataset contains the following key columns:

| Column    | Type    | Description                        |
|-----------|---------|------------------------------------|

| Product   | String  | Name of the agricultural product   |
| Category  | String  | Product category (e.g., Grains)    |
| Sales     | Numeric | Sales amount (in local currency)    |
| Quantity  | Integer | Number of units sold                |

**Preprocessing:**  
- Handled missing values and outliers.
